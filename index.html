<p>From the traditional Indian perspective, Vyāsa is the complier of the Vedas and he himself wrote the explanation of Vedānta in the Bhāgavata Purāṇa. Therein he establishes that the Absolute Truth is indeed a person. Those who come in the line of Vyāsa, including Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī, accept therefore that the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam is the natural and authoritative commentary on the Vedānta-sūtras. Being composed in Sanskrit, Śrīmad Bhāgavatam is prone to interpretation. Hence the need arose for a thorough analysis that could resolve the thorny issues of interpretation. For this purpose, and to synthesize the message of the entire gamut of Vedic literature, Jīva Gosvāmī wrote the Ṣaṭ Sandarbha.</p>
<p>The original name of the Ṣaṭ Sandarbha was Bhāgavata Sandarbha, indicating that it is an exposition and analysis of the essential message of Śrīmad Bhāgavata Purāṇa. In this work, Śrī Jīva offers a comprehensive and exhaustive analysis of  Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, and concludes the highest feature of the Absolute is a personal God.</p>
<p>Jīva Gosvāmī’s Sat Sandarbhas consist of six parts, each delving into a different aspect of the Bhāgavatam philosophy. First is the Tattva Sandarbha, which has two divisions. In the first division, Śrī Jīva sets forth the pramāṇas, or the epistemology of the personalist school. Here he tackles such questions as: What are the means of attaining knowledge? And, what is the evidence or proof in support of those means? In the second division he gives the prameya; that is, he explains the object to be realized by knowledge.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-5">
<p>In the second book, Bhagavat Sandarbha, Jīva Gosvāmī speaks about the Bhagavān, His abode, and His associates. He demonstrates with conclusive evidence that Bhagavān is the complete and indivisible Absolute Reality and that all other manifestations are dependent on and thus inferior to Him.</p>
<p>In Paramātma Sandarbha, Śrī Jīva tells of the three manifestations of Bhagavān’s Immanent Being and describes how the Immanent Being is related with each individual self in the material world. Śrī Jīva also describes māyā, or the external potency of God.</p>
<p>In Kṛṣṇa Sandarbha, he shows that the form of Kṛṣṇa is the original form of Bhagavān and explains why He is the object of loving devotional service. Then, in the Bhakti Sandarbha, Śrī Jīva establishes the path of devotion as the sole means to direct God realization. Finally, in Prīti Sandarbha, he analyses prema-bhakti, devotional service in pure love of God, and shows how it is the supreme goal of life for all living beings.</p>

                <p>The second book of Jīva Gosvāmī’s Ṣaṭ Sandarbhas, is quite simply a book about Bhagavān, or God, the Supreme Being. To avoid narrow and misleading notions, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī first establishes an objective and far-reaching context in which Bhagavān can be self-evidently understood, free from constrictive or reductionist interpretations. In striking opposition to popular spiritual ideas, such as "All is One," he supplies the reader with knowledge of Ultimate Reality with unparalleled precision and exacting detail.</p>
                  <p>This Reality, which is described as Nondual Consciousness (advaya-jñāna), is realized in three aspects: as Brahman (God without any qualities, the Unqualified Absolute), as Paramātmā (the Immanent Self residing in each of us), and as Bhagavān (the all-powerfull, all-blissful, infinitely charming playful Person). Jīva Gosvāmī analyzes each of these aspects and demonstrates with conclusive evidence that Bhagavān is the complete and indivisible Absolute Reality and that all other manifestations are dependent on, and thus subordinate to, Him.</p>

                <p>“The Sandarbhas of Śrī Jīva Gosvāmin represent the highest exegetical and philosophical theology of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava school. Satyanārāyaṇa dāsa Bābā is uniquely positioned to translate them since he was trained by the 20th century's most prolific and knowledgeable Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava scholar, Śrī Haridāsa Śāstrī, whose published editions and Hindī translations and commentaries of Gauḍīya works are well known to all scholars of the tradition. Satyanārāyaṇa brings a sensitivity to academic discourse, having taught at a number of American and European universities, as well as a seasoned understanding of Indian logic, grammar, hermeneutics, and poetics, all of which Jīva draws upon in his Sandarbhas. This first installment, the Bhagavat Sandarbha, will surely be a welcomed and widely used text by Krishna devotees, Indologists, and scholars of Indian religion in general.”

                          <p>“Gaudiya Vaishnavism is one of the most important traditions to emerge in devotional Hinduism, and is primarily responsible for the eruption of Krishna devotion that spread across especially the North of India in the 16th century.  Despite being a grass roots movement, the school has deep scholastic roots in the Vedanta tradition and larger philosophical landscape of its time.  This philosophical basis is encapsulated in the six-volume Sandarbha treatise written by Jiva Gosvamin, the primary theologian of the tradition.  Satyanarayana Dasa's rendition of the Bhagavat Sandarbha, to be followed by the remaining volumes, combines superb Sanskrit and hermeneutical skills with academic standards of scholarship. This volume will be well received by all scholars and students of Vedanta and devotional Hinduism.”

                <h3>Satyanarayana Dasa</h3>
                <h5>Chief Author and Translator</h5>
<p>Satyanarayana Dasa, born in 1954, was drawn to the spiritual traditions of his home country India since his childhood. After receiving a postgraduate degree in 1978 from IIT Delhi and working in the United States for four years, he returned to India. There he studied the formal systems of Indian philosophy known as Ṣaḍ-darśana under the direct guidance of his guru Śrī Haridāsa Śāstrī Mahārāja and Swami Śyāma Śaraṇa Mahārāja.</p>
<p>This education was taken up in the traditional manner for more than 25 years, while he dedicated himself as a practitioner of bhakti yoga. In 1991 he accepted the traditional Vaiṣṇava order of renounced life, bābājī-veṣa. His main focus has been with the works of Jīva Gosvāmī, particularly on translating the Ṣaṭ Sandarbhas, into English and commenting on them. He also earned four śāstric degrees, and received both a law degree and a PhD in Sanskrit from Agra University.</p>
<p>Satyanarayana Dasa is the director of the Jiva Institute of Vaishnava Studies in Vrindavan, India. He is a visiting professor at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  In 2013 he was honored by the president of India, Pranab Mukherjee, for his extraordinary contribution in presenting Vedic culture and philosophy, both nationally and internationally.</p>

                <h5>Editor and Collaborator</h5>
                <p>Navadvipa das (Bruce Martin) has been an avid student and practitioner of Devotional Vedanta for the last thirty-five years. He has lived in India since 1990 where he studied Sanskrit, Hindi and Bengali. He has been involved in the translation and editing of ancient Gaudiya Vaishnava texts for the last twenty years.</p> 
                    <p>His principal concern in this endeavor has been in trying to bring out the significance of such works for a modern audience. In order to do so, he felt it essential
to be in touch with the widest possible array of knowledge systems in general and wisdom traditions in particular, so as to identify the most essential points of correspondence. Toward this end, he has devoted years of study to multiple disciplines, including world religion, mythology, transpersonal psychology, eastern and western philosophy, science and culture, linguistics, and holistic healing systems, including Qigong, Ayurveda and Reiki. He lives with his wife, Suniti, in the mountain resort of Manali, Himachal Pradesh.</p>

                <h5>Editor and Collaborator</h5>
                <p>Jagadananda Das (Jagat), a.k.a. Jan K. Brzezinksi (b. 1950), joined ISKCON in Toronto, Canada, in 1970 and was initiated by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. In 1979, he joined the son and disciple of Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakur, Lalita Prasad Thakur from whom he took dīkṣā and vairāgya (bābājī veṣa). He was given the name Jagadānanda Dās Bābājī. For the next five years he studied the literature of the sampradāya in Nabadwip and was given the title Bhakti-śāstrī by the Bhaktivinoda Goṣṭhī in 1982.</p>

<p>In 1985, he returned to Canada and took courses in comparative religious studies and the history of religions at McGill University, getting top honors. In 1988 he was awarded the Commonwealth Scholarship to study for his doctorate at the School of Oriental and African Studies. In 1992 he was awarded a Ph.D. in Sanskrit Literature, the subject of which was the Gopāla-campū of Śrīla Jīva Goswāmī. In 2007, he returned to India where he taught Sanskrit and studied yoga meditation at Swami Rama Sadhaka Grama in Rishikesh. Since 2010 he has been living in Vrindavan where he has been working with Satyanarayan Dasa in translating and editing the Sandarbhas.</p>

<p>Jagadananda Das is the editor of an on-line repository of Sanskrit texts called Gaudiya Grantha Mandir (www.granthamandira.com) and of an online magazine called Vrindavan Today (news.vrindavantoday.org).</p>
